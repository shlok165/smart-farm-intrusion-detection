# smart-farm-intrusion-detection
A low-power edge AI system for detecting and deterring wildlife entering farmland. Uses PIR sensing, camera vision, and lightweight ML models to identify animals like boars, cows, monkeys, and stray dogs. Supports day/night operation, non-lethal deterrents, and reduces false alarms using sensor fusion.
